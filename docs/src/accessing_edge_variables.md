# Accessing edge values

#### Topics covered in this tutorial include:
 * accessing edge values via helper function GetGD
 * accessing edge values using SavingCallback

Based on the example `getting-started.jl`, we explain in this tutorial how to access the edge values at any time $t$ of the simulation. `NetworkDynamics.jl` offers several possibilities for this purpose. In the following, we will present two different ways how the values of the edges can be retrieved at a time $t$ to be able to access them later.
